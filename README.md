# MicroMouse-Apogee

In this project we have designed and built a Micromouse using Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. It utilises the FloodFill algorithm for dynamic maze navigation of the mouse. It enables the mouse to successfully traverse a maze of any dimension. Unlike conventional methods, it doesn't require any prior knowledge of the maze's design.
